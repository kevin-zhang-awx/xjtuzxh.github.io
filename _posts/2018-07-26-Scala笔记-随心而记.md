##case class

case class适用于对不变数据进行建模,
```scala
case class Book(isbn: String)

val frankenstein = Book("978-0486282114")
```

**NOTICE**

Case classes are compared by structure and not by reference:

**Pattern matching**

case class 适合处理Pattern matching

```scala
abstract class Notification

case class Email(sender: String, title: String, body: String) extends Notification

case class SMS(caller: String, message: String) extends Notification

case class VoiceRecording(contactName: String, link: String) extends Notification


def showNotification(notification: Notification): String = {
  notification match {
    case Email(email, title, _) =>
      s"You got an email from $email with title: $title"
    case SMS(number, message) =>
      s"You got an SMS from $number! Message: $message"
    case VoiceRecording(name, link) =>
      s"you received a Voice Recording from $name! Click the link to hear it: $link"
  }
}
val someSms = SMS("12345", "Are you there?")
val someVoiceRecording = VoiceRecording("Tom", "voicerecording.org/id/123")

println(showNotification(someSms))  // prints You got an SMS from 12345! Message: Are you there?

println(showNotification(someVoiceRecording))  // you received a Voice Recording from Tom! Click the link to hear it: voicerecording.org/id/123
```
